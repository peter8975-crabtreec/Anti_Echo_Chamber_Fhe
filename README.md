# Anti Echo Chamber FHE: A Revolutionary DeSoc Platform

Anti Echo Chamber FHE is a cutting-edge decentralized social networking platform that intelligently addresses the challenge of echo chambers through the power of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. By encrypting user social graphs and opinions, our platform facilitates the selective recommendation of diverse viewpoints, fostering healthier public discourse and breaking through the walls of information silos.

## Understanding the Problem

In today's digital landscape, many individuals find themselves trapped in echo chambers, where they are only exposed to viewpoints that reinforce their own beliefs. This phenomenon contributes to polarization, misinformation, and unhealthy public discussions. Users often struggle to discover alternative perspectives that can enrich their understanding and promote constructive dialogue. 

## The FHE Solution

The Anti Echo Chamber FHE platform employs Zama's groundbreaking Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology to securely analyze user interactions and provide tailored content recommendations while maintaining privacy. By leveraging open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we ensure that user data is not only protected but also utilized to foster a more diverse social environment. Our content recommendation algorithm operates on encrypted data, allowing us to suggest "different yet relevant" viewpoints without exposing sensitive information.

## Key Features

- üîí **FHE-Encrypted Social Graphs:** User interactions are encrypted, ensuring confidentiality while still allowing for meaningful analysis.
- üåê **Diversity-Focused Recommendation Algorithm:** The platform intelligently suggests contrasting viewpoints, enhancing user exposure to a broader array of opinions.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-First Public Discourse:** Users can engage in discussions on pressing societal matters, confident that their privacy is safeguarded.
- üåà **Configurable Feed & Opinion Graph:** Users can customize their experience by tuning the information flow and the opinion graph to align with their values and preferences.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Node.js** (for backend services)
- **Hardhat** (for Ethereum smart contract development)
- **Solidity** (for smart contract coding)

## Installation Guide

To get started with the Anti Echo Chamber FHE project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (ensure version 14.x or higher)
2. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) (or Foundry, if preferred)

**Installation Steps:**

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command will fetch all the required libraries, including Zama‚Äôs Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK, allowing you to get started without any delay.

## Build & Run Guide

Once the installation is complete, you can compile and run the Anti Echo Chamber FHE project with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests to Ensure Everything Works:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

This will launch the platform and allow you to explore its features and functionalities.

### Example Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a brief illustration of how the core recommendation algorithm works within the Anti Echo Chamber FHE platform:

```javascript
const { encryptOpinionGraph } = require('./socialGraphAnalysis');

function generateRecommendations(userOpinions) {
    const encryptedUserOpinions = encryptOpinionGraph(userOpinions);
    const recommendations = recommendDiverseViewpoints(encryptedUserOpinions);
    
    return recommendations;
}

// Usage
const userOpinions = ['Opinion A', 'Opinion B'];
const userRecommendations = generateRecommendations(userOpinions);
console.log(userRecommendations);
```

This snippet shows how user opinions are encrypted and subsequently analyzed to generate diverse recommendations.
